# Learning Objectives

Welcome to R Geospatial Fundamentals. Our goals for today's workshop are:

1.  **Effectively represent data using color, symbols, and other visual elements to highlight patterns in categorical data**

2.  **Understand how transforming data improves data visualizations**

3.  **Interpret the data embedded in maps**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Basics of plotting geospatial data

One of the first things to know about your geospatial data, before getting into any plotting, is to understand the source of your data, along with the details of important information such as what defines the boundary lines and so on.

In this lesson, we will be working with the same two datasets introduced in the previous lesson. The counties dataset, briefly, gives some demographic and houseold information segment by county boundaries in the state of California. The schools dataset provides "California public school locations with school-level demographics for the 2019-20 academic year". More information can be found here

-   counties: <https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/8713ced9b78a4abb97dc130a691a8695>

-   schools_sf: <https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/f7f818b0aa7a415192eaf66f192bc9cc>

Let's load and begin plotting these data.

[Load libraries]{.underline}

```{r}

library(here) #provides a here() command that builds file paths from the project directory
library(sf) # sf = simple features; package designed to simplify analysis of spatial data
```

[Load in datasets]{.underline}

```{r}

#read in the shapefile
counties = st_read(dsn = here("data",  #dsn= data source name
                              "california_counties", 
                              "CaliforniaCounties.shp"))

#read in the schools_sf shapefile using a slightly different syntax
schools_sf = st_read(here("data",
                               "California_Schools_2019-20",
                               "SchoolSites1920.shp"))


#data sources: 
# counties: https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/8713ced9b78a4abb97dc130a691a8695 
# schools_sf: https://gis.data.ca.gov/datasets/f7f818b0aa7a415192eaf66f192bc9cc
```

### Plotting Geometries

We'll start off using the basic `plot` function.

[Visualize what the geometry means]{.underline}

```{r}

#plot the grometry column of the schools_sf dataframe in purple
plot(schools_sf$geometry,col = 'purple') 

```

üîî **Question**: Based on this plot, can you tell what type of geometry the schools_sf dataframe has?

```{r}

#plot the grometry column of the schoo_sf dataframe
plot(counties$geometry) 
```

üîî **Question**: How do we know what the geometry we are plotting represents e.g. a census tract or county boundaries?

### Overlay Plotting

Map overlays a powerful method for visualizing spatial data, particularly across multiple datasets

We can create these with the basic `plot` command. The `add=TRUE` argument is what sets up the overlay by allowing you 'add' maps on top of one another. This argument is used on the plot that is being added.

Let's try to create an overlayed plot:

[Overlay plots using the `plot` function]{.underline}

```{r}

#plot the two geometries together
plot(counties$geometry, col ="lightgrey",border = 'grey')
plot(schools_sf$geometry,col = 'purple', add = TRUE)

#overlaying plots, border and fill colors etc. 
```

üîî **Question**: Why isn't the schools geometry visible? And how can we fix this?

[Transform CRS Codes]{.underline}

```{r}

# change the CRS of the schools spatial dataframe to match the counties dataframe
schools_sf_NAD83 = st_transform(schools_sf, crs= st_crs(counties))

#verify that the two datasets are in the same CRS
st_crs(schools_sf_NAD83) == st_crs(counties) 
```

[Overlay plot the two datasets with the matching CRS codes]{.underline}

```{r}

#plot transformed CRS's
plot(counties$geometry, col ="lightgrey",border = 'grey')
plot(schools_sf_NAD83$geometry, col='purple', add=T)

```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: plotting data with mismatched CRS's can be a simple, common error. Build a habit of always checking the CRS of a dataset before doing any analysis, including plotting.

### Creating Interactive Plots

There are other mapping packages available that allow for nuanced depictions of data, depending on the application. Let's explore a few of them.

`tmap` is one option for mapping that additionally allows for visualizing maps in both static and interactive modes.

[Install and load libraries]{.underline}

```{r}

#install.packages("tmap") #first install the tmap package if you don't already have it

#load in the tmap package
library(tmap)
```

[Plot a quick map using tmap]{.underline}

```{r}
# plot a 'quick tmap' using the qtm function
qtm(counties) 
```

[Switch between tmap's static to interactive mode]{.underline}

```{r}

# toggle the mode (or ttm!)
ttm()

#plot the counties data in 
qtm(counties) #see warning 
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Sometimes during data creation or processing, polygon geometries can gets a bit messed up. It may look great but one or more of the lines may self-intersect or not close (i.e. snap to a node). This can cause some functions to return an error message or warning. The `tmap_options` `check.and.fix` and `st_make_valid` functions repair invalid geometries so that it can render an interactive or static map properly. See the function documentation for more information.

[Repair invalid geometries]{.underline}

```{r}

#fix the data
tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)
counties<-st_make_valid(counties)
schools_sf_NAD83<-st_make_valid(schools_sf_NAD83)

#plot the repaired counties data in interactive mode
qtm(counties)

```

Some interactive features that `tmap` offer include zooming in an out, and toggling over/clicking a geometry to view its attribute data.

The syntax for creating tailored plots using `tmap` is similar to that of `ggplot2`. `tmap` geometry functions (`tm_polygons()`, `tm_dots()`, etc.) allow you to plot the various geometries, and build layers onto the map.

Two main aspects of creating tailored maps using `tmap`'s are to specify the dataset in using the `tm_shape()` function, and the geometry type, for instance, using `tm_polygons`()or `tm_lines()` much like you would use the `ggplot()` to specify the data, and `geom_line()` when using the `ggplot2` package.

Let's try out the `tmap` syntax:

[Exploring more editing options in tmap]{.underline}

```{r}

#switch back to static mode
ttm()

# use the `tm_shape` function to create a tmap object
tm_shape(counties) +  
  tm_polygons(col = 'tan', # add the appropriage geometry, e.g.`tm_polygons` layer
              border.col = 'darkgreen', #make the color of the borders green
              alpha = 0.5) # make the fill color 50% transparent
```

To plot multiple geometries in one plot, add, using `+` plots together. Let's see the syntax for this:

[Overlay plots with tmap]{.underline}

```{r}

tm_shape(counties) +  
  tm_polygons(col = 'tan', 
              border.col = 'darkgreen', 
              alpha = 0.5)+ #note that you use tm_shape first to call the dataset, before later calling what it is. e.g. dots or lines. Just like ggplot
  tm_shape(schools_sf_NAD83) +
  tm_dots(col = 'purple', 
          border.col = 'white', 
          border.lwd = 1, 
          size = 0.01)

#click into one geometry and see info given
```

üîî **Question**: Notice the one school that seems to be outside of California boundaries? What is an easy way to learn more about this datum?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Improving data visualization with thematic maps

The goal of a thematic map is to use color to visualize the spatial distribution of a variable in order to identify trends and outliers.

Thematic maps visually communicate spatial patterns, enabling intuitive interpretation and comparison of patterns and data distributions.

Thematic maps use color to quickly and effectively convey information. For example, maps use brighter or richer colors to signify higher values, and leverage cognitive associations such as mapping water with the color blue.

Let's compare data visualized through a standards bar plot vs a thematic plot

[Load libraries]{.underline}

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
```

[Visualize tge median age per county as a barplot using ggplot]{.underline}

```{r}

#create a plot of the MED_AGE per county, save as a variable p1
p1 <- ggplot(counties, aes(x = NAME, y = MED_AGE)) +
  geom_col() + #plot the data as bar plots 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # adjust the angle of the x-axis text for easier visualization
p1
```

üîî **Question**: Alameda and San Francisco county neighbor one another, how easy is it to relate the median ages of the two counties using this bar plot?

Visualizing the data using this plot emphasizes numerical relationships, while a thematic map places additional emphasis on the geographic distribution of data. Herein lies a a key benefit of geospatial analyses.

There are three main techniques for improving data visualization via thematic maps:

A. Color palettes

B. Data transformations

C. Classification schemes

Let's use these methods on some thematic maps with ggplot:

### A. Color Palettes

Plotting data using XY plot versus mapping adds the additional spatial dimension, via the geometry column, which allows you to visualize how data varies across geographical regions.

`ggplot2` uses the `geom_sf()` function to initiate plotting geospatial data

[Visualize the median age per county as a thematic plot using ggplot]{.underline}

```{r}


p2 <- ggplot(counties, aes(fill = MED_AGE)) + 
  geom_sf() +  # tells ggplot that geographic data are being plotted
  #scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Median Age per County")
p2
```

There are three main types of color palettes (or color maps), each of which has a different purpose: diverging, sequential, and qualitative

![](http://www.gnuplotting.org/figs/colorbrewer.png)

üí° **Tip**: Sites like [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=Blues&n=3) let's you play around with different types of color maps.

Let us visualize the same data using all 3 types of palettes.

[load the library]{.underline}

```{r}

library(RColorBrewer)
```

To see the names of all color palettes available, try the following command. You may need to enlarge the output image.

```{r}
RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()
```

1.  **Diverging color palette** - a "diverging" set of colors are used to emphasize mid-range values as well as extremes.

[Plot data with a diverging pallete]{.underline}

```{r}

Div_plot <- ggplot(counties, aes(fill = MED_AGE)) + 
  geom_sf() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(11, "RdBu")) + # Diverging red-blue color palette
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Median Age per County")

Div_plot
```

This is considered a `proportional color map` because the colors are linearly scaled to the data values. The legend has a continuous color ramp rather than discrete data ranges.

2.  **Sequential color palette** - usually uses a single or multi color hue to emphasize differences in order and magnitude, where darker colors typically mean higher values

Let's plot the MED_AGE counties data using a sequential palette

üîî **Question**: Looking at the script above, what should you change `"RdBu"` to if you wanted a green sequential palette?

-   Hint: you can take a look at the `RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()` to find the correct syntax

[Plot data with a sequential pallete]{.underline}

```{r}

Seq_plot <- ggplot(counties, aes(fill = MED_AGE)) + 
  geom_sf() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(9,"Greens")) + # Sequential greens color palette
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Median Age per County")
  
Seq_plot
```

üîî **Question**: Do you see any preliminary patterns in this map?

3.  **Qualitative color palette** - a contrasting set of colors to identify distinct categories and avoid implying quantitative significance.

[load libraries]{.underline}

```{r}

# load the library that will allow subsetting of data
library(dplyr)
```

Before we plot using a qualitative color palette, let's do some data preprocessing using the dplyr package. Here, we filter for the data where the median age is less than or equal to 32 years. We do this to plot a smaller subset of the data which is easier to visualize than the full dataset.

```{r}

#subset for the counties that have a median age lesser than 32- save as a variable called some_counties
some_counties<- counties %>% filter(MED_AGE<=32)
```

```{r}

#plot the filtered data
Qual_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = some_counties, aes(fill = NAME)) + #since we are using a qualitative color palette, we cannot plot quantitative data 
  scale_fill_manual(values = brewer.pal(8, "Pastel2")) + #Qualitative pastel color pallette
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Selected Counties")
Qual_plot
```

üîî **Question**: What is lacking from this qualitative map?

[Overlay plots with ggplot]{.underline}

```{r}

# over the counties geometry onto the subset_counties plot
Qual_plot_overlay <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = counties, color = "black", fill = "transparent") + #add the overall counties geometry
  geom_sf(data = some_counties, aes(fill = NAME)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = brewer.pal(8, "Pastel2")) + #specify the number of unique colors needed
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Counties with Median Age < or = 32 Highlighted")
Qual_plot_overlay
```

üîî **Question**: is this a `proportional color map?`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: When exploring your data as we are doing here, it is important to note that a qualitative color scheme cannot be applied to quantitative data (like the median age). So for this example, we just applied the qualitative scheme on the county names.

During exploratory mapping, it can be helpful to visualize all versions of a map on the same grid. `gridExtra` is one of the packages that allows you to visualize plots in the same image

Let's visualize all 3 plots together:

[Load the library]{.underline}

```{r}

library(gridExtra)
```

[Visualize multiple plots on one grid]{.underline}

Elements like the title and grid may be useful for individual plots, but cumbersome in joint plots. There are various ways to manipulate plots to add or remove certain elements for improved visualization. In the following example, we remove the plot titles and make the legend smaller.

```{r}

# Remove title from each plot and minimize the legend to prevent overcrowding
Div_plot_1 <- Div_plot  + theme(
  legend.text = element_text(size = 4), #reduce the size of the legend text
  legend.title = element_text(size = 4), #reduce the size of the legend title
  legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "lines"), #reduce the size of the legend itself
  plot.title = element_blank()
)

Seq_plot_1 <- Seq_plot + theme(
  legend.text = element_text(size = 4), #reduce the size of the legend text
  legend.title = element_text(size = 4), #reduce the size of the legend title
  legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "lines"), #reduce the size of the legend itself
  plot.title = element_blank()
)

Qual_plot_overlay_1 <- Qual_plot_overlay + theme(
  legend.text = element_text(size = 4), #reduce the size of the legend text
  legend.title = element_text(size = 4), #reduce the size of the legend title
  legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "lines"), #reduce the size of the legend itself
  plot.title = element_blank()
)

# combine the plots into one grid, with 3 columns
combined_plot <- grid.arrange(Div_plot_1, Seq_plot_1, Qual_plot_overlay_1, ncol=3)

# Print the combined plot
combined_plot


```

üîî **Question**: List some pros and cons of plotting the median age per county using the different color palettes\

As a best practice, a **qualitative** color palette should not be used with **quantitative** data and vice versa.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ü•ä Challenge 1: Choosing and appropriate color palette

1.  Which types of color palettes would most accurately represent the following data:
    1.  The percent of students that are mixed race ( `MRpct`)
    2.  The school level (e.g. Preschool, Elementary, High) (`SchoolLeve)`
    3.  Whether or not the school is a charter school or not (`Charter`)
    4.  The California Senate District that the school falls in (`SenateCA`), e.g. district 09 etc.
2.  Select the appropriate color palette from R brewer, and plot each data using that palette. Save the plots with the following variable names:
    1.  MRpct_plot
    2.  For the SenateCA, the starting code has been provided which filters the data for easier viewing

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Some data may be encoded with numbers, but may not be numeric or quantitative data. You can check the type of data using the `class()` function. e.g. `class(scholls_sf$SenateCA)`

[Senate CA]{.underline}

```{r}

#filter out only select senate districts
some_schools<- schools_sf%>% filter(SenateCA %in% c("09","12","33","18","25","15"))

SenateCA_plot
```

```{r}

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

Solution

```{r}

SchoolLeve_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = schools_sf, aes(color = SchoolLeve)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2")) + #Qualitative  color pallette
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "School Level")
SchoolLeve_plot


Charter_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = schools_sf, aes(color = Charter)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = brewer.pal(8, "Paired")) + #Qualitative  color pallette
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Charter School? Y or N")
Charter_plot


SenateCA_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = some_schools, aes(color = SenateCA)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = brewer.pal(8, "Set1")) + #Qualitative  color pallette
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "California Senate District")
SenateCA_plot


MRpct_plot <- ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data=schools_sf, aes(color = MRpct)) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(9, "Greens")) + # Sequential greens color palette
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Mixed Race Percent")
MRpct_plot
#or 
MRpct_plot <- ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data=schools_sf, aes(color = MRpct)) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(9, "RdBu")) + # Diverging red-blue color palette
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Mixed Race Percent")
MRpct_plot
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two major challenges when creating thematic maps:

1.  Our eyes are drawn to the color of larger areas or linear features, even if the values of smaller features are more significant.

2.  The range of data values is rarely evenly distributed across all observations and thus the colors can be misleading - as we saw a bit with the Mixed Race Percent plot

Selecting the appropriate color palette can help mitigate these challenges. Sometimes, this alone is not enough. Transforming data can improve the way data values are associated with colors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Transforming Count Data

-   Data aggregation is where individual-level data e.g. data from people, households, or businesses are summarized into higher geographic levels such as states, counties, or census tracts

-   Aggregated data such as counts (e.g. the total population in a state) presents a broader overview

-   To make these counts more comparable across regions, especially those that differ greatly in size, data is transform into normalized variables.

-   Normalized variables including densities, proportions, or ratios, provide a standardized basis for comparison, allowing for more meaningful understanding of trends and patterns

Let's transform **count** data using **densities**, **proportions**, and **ratios** and visualize the data using `tmap`:

-   `tmap` (which stands for thematic maps) creates maps using using syntax similar to `ggplot2`. `tmap` plots the different geometries (points, lines, polygons) using `tm_symbols`, `tm_lines`, and `tm_polygon` respectively.

**A. Visualizing data as Counts**

Count data are counts, aggregated by feature (county)

-   e.g. population within a county

[plot count data using `tmap`]{.underline}

```{r}

# Map of individuals who identify with multiple races
Count_plot <- tm_shape(counties) +
  tm_polygons(col='MULT_RACE', alpha=0.5, #alpha specifies the level of transparency
              palette="Greens", #syntax for specifying color pelettes with tmap plots
              title = "number of multi-race individuals")


Count_plot
```

-   The data is aggregated by county boundaries and shows the number of people who identify with multiple races per county.

üîî **Question**: What happens if there are more people in a county?

Let's look at the distribution of the data using a histogram.

[plotting data distribution via a histogram]{.underline}

```{r}

#plotting the distribution of people who identify with multiple races per county
hist(counties$MULT_RACE,
     breaks = 40, # number of bins that the range of values is divided into
     main = 'number of multi-race individuals') #title 
```

-   the distribution shows that many people fall on the lowest end of the distribution, and there seems to be an outlier at the highest end.

-   such an uneven distribution is not accurately represented using count data

-   The basic cartographic rule is that when mapping data for areas that differ in size you rarely map counts since those differences in size make the comparison less valid or informative.

Data transformations overcome these limitations of count data.

**B. Visualizing data as Densities**

Density data is counts aggregated by feature (county) and normalized by feature area

-   *e.g. number of individuals who identify with multiple races per square mile within a county*

[Transform data based on area]{.underline}

```{r}

#View the data to identify column containing county area
colnames(counties)
# the "SQ_MILES" column contains the area of each county in square miles

#create a new column that contains the multi_race density data
counties$MULT_RACE_SQ_MILE<-counties$MULT_RACE/counties$SQ_MI

Density_plot<- tm_shape(counties) +
  tm_polygons(col='MULT_RACE_SQ_MILE', alpha=0.5,
              palette="Greens",
              title = "number of multi-race individuals per square mile")
Density_plot
```

üîî **Question**: What are some changes we can make to the map that may highlight certain trends better

[Change the tmap color palette and translucency]{.underline}

```{r}

Density_plot_2<- tm_shape(counties) +
  tm_polygons(col='MULT_RACE_SQ_MILE', alpha=0.8,
              palette="YlOrRd",
              title = "number of multi-race individuals per square mile")
Density_plot_2
```

Visualizing tmap plots side-by-side

```{r}

#install.packages("tmaptools")
library(tmaptools)

# Assuming you have tmap plots named plot1, plot2, plot3, and plot4
Density_plot_combined <- tmap_arrange(Density_plot, Density_plot_2, ncol = 2)

Density_plot_combined 
```

üîî **Question**: How can you easily view the county(ies) that have a high number of individuals that identify with multiple races?

```{r}
ttm()

Density_plot
```

Normalizing data via densities makes the data more accurate in some cases and more comparable across regions of different sizes.

**C. Visualizing data as Percents/Proportions**

**Proportions / Percentages data** represents datain a specific category divided by the total value across all categories

*e.g. number of individuals that identify with multiple races, as a percent of the total county population*

Now you try it! Plot the 'MULT_RACE counties data as a percent

-   What should you divide `counties$MULT_RACE` to convert it to a percent?
-   Hint: use the total population in 2012

```{r}

#create a new column that contains the multi_race proportion data
counties$MULT_RACE_PERC<-counties$MULT_RACE/counties$POP2012 *100

Percent_plot <- tm_shape(counties) +
  tm_polygons(col='MULT_RACE_PERC', alpha=0.5,
              palette="YlOrRd",
              title = "number of multi-race individuals per total county percent")
Percent_plot
```

## ü•ä Challenge 2: **Visualizing data as Ratios**

**D. Visualizing data as Ratios**

**Rates / Ratios data** represent a value in one category divided by value in another category

1.  Create a new variable "MULT_to_OTHER" that is the ratio of the number of individuals that identify with multiple races to the number of individuals who identify as "OTHER"
2.  plot a histogram to see the distribution
3.  create a plot, named Ratio_plot, of this distribution using `tmap`, and a diverging color palette
4.  identify the county with the highest ratio
5.  combine this and the three previous plots onto one grid

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Solution**

```{r}

counties$MULT_to_OTHER<-counties$MULT_RACE/counties$OTHER

#plotting the distribution of people who identify with multiple races per county
hist(counties$MULT_to_OTHER,
     breaks = 40, # number of bins that the range of values is divided into
     main = 'ratio of multi-race to other') #title 

Ratio_plot <- tm_shape(counties) +
  tm_polygons(col='MULT_to_OTHER', alpha=0.8,
              palette="PiYG",
              title = "... ")
Ratio_plot 


Tranform_plot_combined <- tmap_arrange(Count_plot, Density_plot, Percent_plot, Ratio_plot, ncol = 4)

Tranform_plot_combined 
```

Transformations help with ... C**lassification schemes** can improve the way data values are associated with colors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Saving spatial dataframes (and plots (?))

It's helpful to be able to save data, especially if it has been made into a spatial dataframe or transformed as we did here, in a format that streamlines continued manipulation and analysis.

The `st_write()` function is used to save spatial dataframes in the available file types (e.g. `.shp`)

Since we did some transformations to the counties dataframe, let's save it as a new file that we can continue to work with.

[saving a spatial dataframe]{.underline}

```{r}

st_write(counties, 
         here("data",
              "california_counties",
              "CaliforniaCounties_modified.shp"))

#difference with saving CSV file, using layers_option, and explantion of "Well Known Text" 
#clarify whether the CRS is stored with CSV
```

Spatial dataframes can be saved as different file extensions which including `.json`, `.gpkg` etc. which have specific nuances. Read more about the different file types to determine which may best suite your application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üé¨ Demo:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: plotting qualitative data using readily available color palettes like Pastel2 can become limited because each palette contains a predefined number of colors. For this palette, the max is 8, so if you need more colors, explore how to create your own color palette set.

Often enough, you may want to create a thematic map that requires more colors than are contained within a predefined color palette, or you may just want to create your own.

R has a list of colors with their associated color codes that can be manually used.

Let's use this example to plot the different types of school (n=14) using a manual color palette.

[Manually defining a set of colors for a qualitative plot]{.underline}

```{r}

schools_plot_2 <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = schools_sf, aes(color = SchoolType)) +  # Use color aesthetic for points
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#e41a1c", "#377eb8", "#4daf4a", "#ff7f00", "#a65628", "#984ea3", "#999999", "#e41a1c", "#377eb8", "#4daf4a", "#ff7f00", "#a65628", "#984ea3", "#999999")) +  # Custom palette with 14 colors
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "School Type")
print(schools_plot_2)
```

## Key Points

-   Thematic maps emphasize the geographic distribution and relationships of the data that are not easily discernible using standard plots (like barplots)
-   There are different packages that allow you to visualize geospatial data, using the `plot()` function, or the `tmap` or `ggplot2` packages. Each has different eases of use and different benefits.
-   Understanding your data and knowing what aspects you want to emphasize enable you to utilize different color palettes andtransformations to emphasize key aspects of the geographic distribution of the data.
