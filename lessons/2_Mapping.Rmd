------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Improving data visualization with thematic maps

The goal of a thematic map is to use color to visualize the spatial distribution of a variable in order to identify trends, outliers, and the like.

Thematic maps use color to quickly and effectively convey information. For example, maps use brighter or richer colors to signify higher values, and leverage cognitive associations such as mapping water with the color blue. These maps visually communicate spatial patterns, enabling intuitive interpretation and comparison of patterns and data distributions.

Let's compare data on median age, visualized through a standard bar plot vs a thematic plot.

[Load libraries]{.underline}

```{r}

#load the library
library(ggplot2)
```

[Visualize the median age per county as a barplot using ggplot]{.underline}

```{r}

#create a plot of the MED_AGE per county, save as a variable p1
p1 <- ggplot(counties, aes(x = NAME, y = MED_AGE)) +
  geom_col() + #plot the data as bar plots 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # adjust the angle of the x-axis text for easier visualization
p1
```

üîî **Question**: Alameda and San Francisco county neighbor one another, how easy is it to relate the median ages of the two counties using this bar plot?

Visualizing the data using this plot emphasizes numerical relationships, while a thematic map places additional emphasis on the geographic distribution of data. Herein lies a a key benefit of geospatial analyses.

There are three main techniques for improving data visualization via thematic maps:

A. Color palettes

B. Data transformations

C. Classification schemes

Let's use these methods on some thematic maps with ggplot:

### A. Color Palettes

Mapping data geospatially, versus plotting data using XY plot (like the barplot above), adds the additional spatial dimension, via the geometry column, which allows you to visualize how data varies across geographical regions.

`ggplot2` uses the `geom_sf()` function to initiate plotting geospatial data

[Visualize the median age per county as a thematic plot using ggplot]{.underline}

```{r}


p2 <- ggplot(counties, aes(fill = MED_AGE)) + 
  geom_sf() +  # tells ggplot that geographic data are being plotted
  #scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Median Age per County")
p2
```

There are three main types of color palettes (or color maps), each of which has a different purpose: diverging, sequential, and qualitative.

![](http://www.gnuplotting.org/figs/colorbrewer.png)

üí° **Tip**: Sites like [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=Blues&n=3) let's you play around with different types of color maps.

Let us visualize the same data using all 3 types of palettes.

[load the library]{.underline}

```{r}

library(RColorBrewer)
```

To see the names of all color palettes available, try the following command. You may need to enlarge the output image.

```{r}
RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()
```

1.  **Diverging color palette** - a "diverging" set of colors are used to emphasize mid-range values as well as extremes.

[Plot data with a diverging pallete]{.underline}

```{r}

Div_plot <- ggplot(counties, aes(fill = MED_AGE)) + 
  geom_sf() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(11, "RdBu")) + # Diverging red-blue color palette
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Median Age per County")

Div_plot
```

This is considered a `proportional color map` because the colors are linearly scaled to the data values. The legend has a continuous color ramp rather than discrete data ranges.

2.  **Sequential color palette** - usually uses a single or multi- color hue to emphasize differences in order and magnitude, where darker colors typically mean higher values

Let's plot the MED_AGE counties data using a sequential palette

üîî **Question**: Looking at the script above, what should you change `"RdBu"` to if you wanted a green sequential palette?

-   Hint: you can take a look at the `RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()` to find the correct syntax

[Plot data with a sequential pallete]{.underline}

```{r}

Seq_plot <- ggplot(counties, aes(fill = MED_AGE)) + 
  geom_sf() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(9,"Greens")) + # Sequential greens color palette
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Median Age per County")
  
Seq_plot
```

üîî **Question**: Do you see any preliminary patterns in this map?

3.  **Qualitative color palette** - a contrasting set of colors to identify distinct categories and avoid implying quantitative significance.

Before we plot using a qualitative color palette, let's do some data preprocessing using the dplyr package.

[load libraries]{.underline}

```{r}

# load the library that will allow subsetting of data
library(dplyr)
```

Here, we will filter for the data where the median age is less than or equal to 32 years, using the `filter()` function. We do this to plot a smaller subset of the data which is easier to visualize than the full dataset. This helps the eye and brain digest the data.

[subse (filter) the data]{.underline}

```{r}

#subset for the counties that have a median age lesser than 32- save as a variable called some_counties
some_counties<- counties %>% filter(MED_AGE<=32)
```

[plot the subsetted data]{.underline}

```{r}

#plot the filtered data
Qual_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = some_counties, aes(fill = NAME)) + #since we are using a qualitative color palette, we cannot plot quantitative data 
  scale_fill_manual(values = brewer.pal(8, "Pastel2")) + #Qualitative pastel color pallette
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Selected Counties")
Qual_plot
```

üîî **Question**: What is lacking from this qualitative map?

[Overlay plots with ggplot]{.underline}

```{r}

# over the counties geometry onto the subset_counties plot
Qual_plot_overlay <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = counties, color = "black", fill = "transparent") + #add the overall counties geometry
  geom_sf(data = some_counties, aes(fill = NAME)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = brewer.pal(8, "Pastel2")) + #specify the number of unique colors needed
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Counties with Median Age < or = 32 Highlighted")
Qual_plot_overlay
```

üîî **Question**: is this a `proportional color map?`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: When exploring your data as we are doing here, it is important to note that a qualitative color scheme cannot be applied to quantitative data (like the median age). So for this example, we just applied the qualitative scheme on the county names.

During exploratory mapping, it can be helpful to visualize all versions of a map on the same grid. `gridExtra` is one of the packages that allows you to visualize plots in the same image

Let's visualize all 3 plots we just created together:

[Load the library]{.underline}

```{r}

#load the library to help visualize plots together
library(gridExtra)
```

[Visualize multiple plots on one grid]{.underline}

Elements like the title and grid may be useful for individual plots, but cumbersome in joint plots. There are various ways to manipulate plots to add or remove certain elements for improved visualization. In the following example, we remove the plot titles and make the legend smaller, then we combine the plots. Don't get stuck in the syntax for editing the plots!

```{r}

# Remove title from each plot and minimize the legend to prevent overcrowding
Div_plot_1 <- Div_plot  + theme(
  legend.text = element_text(size = 4), #reduce the size of the legend text
  legend.title = element_text(size = 4), #reduce the size of the legend title
  legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "lines"), #reduce the size of the legend itself
  plot.title = element_blank()
)

Seq_plot_1 <- Seq_plot + theme(
  legend.text = element_text(size = 4), #reduce the size of the legend text
  legend.title = element_text(size = 4), #reduce the size of the legend title
  legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "lines"), #reduce the size of the legend itself
  plot.title = element_blank()
)

Qual_plot_overlay_1 <- Qual_plot_overlay + theme(
  legend.text = element_text(size = 4), #reduce the size of the legend text
  legend.title = element_text(size = 4), #reduce the size of the legend title
  legend.key.size = unit(0.5, "lines"), #reduce the size of the legend itself
  plot.title = element_blank()
)

# combine the plots into one grid, with 3 columns
combined_plot <- grid.arrange(Div_plot_1, Seq_plot_1, Qual_plot_overlay_1, ncol=3)

# Print the combined plot
combined_plot


```

üîî **Question**: List some pros and cons of plotting the median age per county using the different color palettes\

Remembers, as a best practice, a **qualitative** color palette should not be used with **quantitative** data and vice versa.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ü•ä Challenge 1: Choosing and appropriate color palette

1.  Which types of color palettes would most accurately represent the following data:
    1.  The percent of students that are mixed race ( `MRpct`)
    2.  The school level (e.g. Preschool, Elementary, High) (`SchoolLeve)`
    3.  Whether or not the school is a charter school or not (`Charter`)
    4.  The California Senate District that the school falls in (`SenateCA`), e.g. district 09 etc.
2.  Select the appropriate color palette from R brewer, and plot each data using that palette. Save the plots with the following variable names:
    1.  MRpct_plot
    2.  SchoolLeve_plot
    3.  Charter_plot
    4.  For the SenateCA, the starting code has been provided which filters the data by selecting only a few districts, for easier viewing

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Some data may be encoded with numbers, but may not be numeric or quantitative data. You can check the type of data using the `class()` function. e.g. `class(scholls_sf$SenateCA)`

[Senate CA]{.underline}

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two major challenges when creating thematic maps:

1.  Our eyes are drawn to the color of larger areas or linear features, even if the values of smaller features are more significant.

2.  The range of data values is rarely evenly distributed across all observations and thus the colors can be misleading as we saw a bit with the Mixed Race Percent plot

Selecting the appropriate color palette can help mitigate these challenges. Sometimes, this alone is not enough. Transforming data can improve the way data values are associated with colors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Transforming Count Data

Data aggregation is where individual-level data e.g. data from people, households, or businesses are summarized into higher geographic levels such as states, counties, or census tracts

Aggregated data such as counts (e.g. the total population in a state) presents a broader overview

To make these counts more comparable across regions, especially those that differ greatly in size, data is transform into normalized variables.

Normalized variables including densities, proportions, or ratios, provide a standardized basis for comparison, allowing for more meaningful understanding of trends and patterns

Let's transform **count** data using **densities**, **proportions**, and **ratios** and visualize the data using `tmap`:

**A. Visualizing data as Counts**

Count data are individual-level data (e.g. population), aggregated by feature (e.g. county)

-   e.g. population within a county

[plot count data using `tmap`]{.underline}

```{r}

# Map of individuals who identify with multiple races
Count_plot <- tm_shape(counties) +
  tm_polygons(col='MULT_RACE', alpha=0.5, #alpha specifies the level of transparency
              palette="Greens", #syntax for specifying color pelettes with tmap plots
              title = "number of multi-race individuals")


Count_plot
```

The data is aggregated by county boundaries and shows the number of people who identify with multiple races per county.

üîî **Question**: What happens if there are more people in a county?

Let's look at the distribution of the data using a histogram.

[plotting data distribution via a histogram]{.underline}

```{r}

#plotting the distribution of people who identify with multiple races per county
hist(counties$MULT_RACE,
     breaks = 40, # number of bins that the range of values is divided into
     main = 'number of multi-race individuals') #title 
```

The distribution shows that many people fall on the lowest end of the distribution, and there seems to be an outlier at the highest end.

Such an uneven distribution is not accurately represented using count data.

The basic cartographic rule is that when mapping data for areas that differ in size you rarely map counts since those differences in size make the comparison less valid or informative.

Data transformations overcome these limitations of count data.

**B. Visualizing data as Densities**

Density data is counts aggregated by feature (county) and normalized by feature area

-   e.g. number of individuals who identify with multiple races per square mile within a county

[Transform data based on area]{.underline}

```{r}

#View the data to identify column containing county area
colnames(counties)
# the "SQ_MILES" column contains the area of each county in square miles

#create a new column that contains the multi_race density data
counties$MULT_RACE_SQ_MILE<-counties$MULT_RACE/counties$SQ_MI

Density_plot<- tm_shape(counties) +
  tm_polygons(col='MULT_RACE_SQ_MILE', alpha=0.5,
              palette="Greens",
              title = "number of multi-race individuals per square mile")
Density_plot
```

üîî **Question**: What are some changes we can make to the map that may highlight certain trends better

[Change the tmap color palette and translucency]{.underline}

```{r}

Density_plot_2<- tm_shape(counties) +
  tm_polygons(col='MULT_RACE_SQ_MILE', alpha=0.8,
              palette="YlOrRd", #recall that sequential color palettes emphasize differences in order and magnitude
              title = "number of multi-race individuals per square mile")
Density_plot_2
```

Remember that is can be helpful to visualize plots side-by-side. The `tmaptools` package has the `tmap_arrange()` function that allows us to do this.

[visualize tmap plots side-by-side]{.underline}

```{r}

#install.packages("tmaptools")
library(tmaptools)

# Assuming you have tmap plots named plot1, plot2, plot3, and plot4
Density_plot_combined <- tmap_arrange(Density_plot, Density_plot_2, ncol = 2)

Density_plot_combined 
```

üîî **Question**: How can you easily view the county(ies) that have a high number of individuals that identify with multiple races?

```{r}
ttm()

Density_plot
```

Normalizing data via densities makes the data more accurate in some cases and more comparable across regions of different sizes. Normalizing data via percentages allows for a direct comparison of the relative contribution, irrespective of size or population.

**C. Visualizing data as Percents/Proportions**

**Proportions / Percentages data** represents data in a specific category divided by the total value across all categories

*e.g. number of individuals that identify with multiple races, as a percent of the total county population*

Now you try it! Plot the 'MULT_RACE counties data as a percent

-   What should you divide `counties$MULT_RACE` to convert it to a percent?
-   Hint: use the total population in 2012

```{r}

#create a new column that contains the multi_race proportion data
counties$MULT_RACE_PERC<-counties$MULT_RACE/counties$POP2012 *100

Percent_plot <- tm_shape(counties) +
  tm_polygons(col='MULT_RACE_PERC', alpha=0.5,
              palette="YlOrRd",
              title = "number of multi-race individuals per total county percent")
Percent_plot
```

## ü•ä Challenge 2: **Visualizing data as Ratios**

**D. Visualizing data as Ratios**

**Rates / Ratios data** represent a value in one category divided by value in another category

1.  Create a new variable "MULT_to_OTHER" that is the ratio of the number of individuals that identify with multiple races to the number of individuals who identify as "OTHER"
2.  plot a histogram to see the distribution
3.  create a plot, named Ratio_plot, of this distribution using `tmap`, and a diverging color palette
4.  Visually identify the county with the highest ratio
5.  combine this and the three previous plots onto one grid

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üé¨ Demo:

Often enough, you may want to create a thematic map that requires more colors than are contained within a predefined color palette, like Pastel2 which has a maximum of 8, or you may just want to create your own.

R has a list of colors with their associated color codes that can be manually used.

Let's use this example to plot the different types of school (n=14) using a manual color palette.

[Manually defining a set of colors for a qualitative plot]{.underline}

```{r}

#plot the different types of schools using a manual color palette
schools_plot_2 <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = schools_sf, aes(color = SchoolType)) +  # Use color aesthetic for points
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#e41a1c", "#377eb8", "#4daf4a", "#ff7f00", "#a65628", "#984ea3", "#999999", "#e41a1c", "#377eb8", "#4daf4a", "#ff7f00", "#a65628", "#984ea3", "#999999")) +  # Custom palette with 14 colors
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "School Type")
print(schools_plot_2)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: plotting qualitative data using readily available color palettes can become limited because each palette contains a predefined number of colors. Also, using too many colors may be overwhelming to the viewing and demphasize important aspects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Points

In today's workshop, we focused on how

-   Thematic maps emphasize the geographic distribution and relationships of data that are not easily discernible using standard plots (like barplots)
-   There are different packages that allow you to visualize geospatial data, using the `plot()` function, or the `tmap` or `ggplot2` packages. Each has different eases of use and different benefits.
-   Understanding your data and knowing what aspects you want to emphasize enables you to utilize different color palettes and transformations to emphasize key aspects of the geographic distribution of the data.

We'll continue to dive into different mapping techniques by looking at classification schemes next ...
